# Deterministic Finite Pushdown Automaton (DFPA)

**Neither empty moves, nor multiple moves from a single state: it either moves to a unique other state or it doesn't at all. But now with stacks!**

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_pushdown_automaton), a DFPA "is a variation of the [pushdown automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton)" which, by its turn, is "a type of automaton that employs a stack".
