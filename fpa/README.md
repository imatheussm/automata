# Finite Pushdown Automaton (FPA)

**Now with stacks!**

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_pushdown_automaton), a DFPA "is a variation of the [pushdown automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton)" which, by its turn, is "a type of automaton that employs a stack".

## "Why there's just a FPA folder, and not a DFPA as well?"

Well, I found it hard to grasp the differences between the two, and since I was having some difficulties at the time to implement certain aspects of the FPA and was short of time at the moment, I opted to stick with the FPA only.

That, of course, could change in the foreseeable future.
